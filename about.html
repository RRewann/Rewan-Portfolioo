    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      A Civil Engineering graduate from Pharos University – Construction & Project Management Department – with a strong academic and practical background.
      I ranked first in my class for four consecutive years and graduated with Highest Honors. My graduation project focused on sustainable soil improvement using rice straw, which led to my first international research publication (ICASGE'25).
      <br><br>
      I’ve gained hands-on experience through internships in technical office work, structural detailing, geotechnical engineering and soil investigations, and site execution. These experiences allowed me to work with software like AutoCAD, Revit, ETABS, SAFE, Plaxis 2D and Primavera P6.
      <br><br>
      I’m passionate about multidisciplinary engineering work — combining geotechnical knowledge, project management, and structural coordination — and open to entry-level roles in design offices, technical departments, or academic research.
      <br><br>
      I’m eager to contribute, grow, and be part of meaningful engineering projects.
